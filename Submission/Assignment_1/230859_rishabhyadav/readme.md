# About The Webpage

In this assignment i have made webpage 2 given in the assignment i have used icons from boxicons  and made them to response on hover and clicking with the help of css (they will pop out a bit did this just increasing there size and appropriate padding to align with the increased size and also when hovered over they will change there color also so that user can know that it is a clickable button). I have used flex property to align text and the photo on same line.
I have also used pre made button freely available on https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples
and edited it a bit to match the webpage theme.
