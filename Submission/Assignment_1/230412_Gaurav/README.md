I Have completed the page Shop.
Divided the page into three sections 
1. Navbar
2. c1
3. r1
IN NAVBAR I have used fontawesome icons and linked all the for pages with icons and connected all them together using <a>.


IN C1 , I have made filter sections using div, <label> and the css property flex.
IN R1, I have  used  different divs with class and   flex property to make boxes.Product images are linked relatively from the parent directory. 

 it displays a total of 13 products 
    Each product has:
    An image.
    Brand name.
    Product name and description.
     Price.
     Icons for adding to wishlist and cart.
