I have created two web pages , one is home page and other is shopping bag page.
I divided home page in three parts. first part is left navigation bar (class = navbar) , second is middle items(class = left-content) and third part is big image on the right most side of web page(class = right-content).
shopping bad page shows the items whic are added in the bag.
most difficult part which I faced during creating web page is responsiveness. responsiveness of my web pages is not that much perfect.
