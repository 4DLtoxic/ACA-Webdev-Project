# Readme
I have created a webpage that lists 4 products. It also has a sidebar. The bottom 4 links of the sidebar are not linked to anything yet, but that can be easily updated. The first link, labelled 'Products' links to the top of the webpage.
For responsive, I've added hovering effects to the sidebar as well as to the 'Buy Now' options for the products. To create the products, I've used flexbpox.
The 'Buy Now' options is created with the help of buttons.
